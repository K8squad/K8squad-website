"""Story X.1 (ISI-2240) falsification — hostile-Run blast-radius containment (arch §4.3, §12, §17.1,
S4, NFR-SEC1). Required CI artifact.

Threat model (arch §17.1): every data-plane principal is HOSTILE. A Run executes arbitrary LLM-authored
shell/git/build. This harness proves that a hostile Run in Team-A (principal `alice`) trying to reach
ANOTHER squad's / another principal's / a prior Run's **network, secrets, or workspace** is CONTAINED —
the attempt fails — while the legitimate paths a Run needs (DNS, control plane, its own allowlisted
model endpoint, its own Secret, its own worktree) still work.

Why *computed*, not asserted (§17.1 "tested, not asserted", F6/F7). Containment is not eyeballed: the
harness carries a small **NetworkPolicy evaluator** (K8s egress semantics), an **RBAC/Secret evaluator**
(namespaced Role + `resourceNames` get-by-name), a **workspace-scoping evaluator** (per-principal PVC
subPath), and a **teardown-residue evaluator** (§9.3 teardown-and-replace). Each hostile attempt's
outcome is DERIVED from the posture, so a weakened posture flips the verdict.

Why differential (real teeth). A happy-path "the pod couldn't reach evil.example once" demo passes on a
posture that leaks three other ways. We model TWO postures:
  - `posture_contained`  — the arch §9/§12/§17.1 posture (default-deny egress + named/audited model hole,
                           namespaced least-priv RBAC get-by-name, per-principal PVC subPath,
                           teardown-and-replace). Must hold EVERY blast-radius invariant.
  - `posture_porous`     — a plausible-but-wrong posture (no egress policy, ClusterRole cross-ns secrets,
                           shared PVC root mount, in-place reset leaving residue). Every containment axis
                           this story pins is BREACHED — the harness must DETECT each, or it has no teeth.

Gate ISI-2113 (RuntimeClass pick) — CLEARED: gVisor default / Kata opt-in / runc rejected for untrusted
code (Story 4.2, ISI-2292/2294). This harness is the S4 blast-radius layer that sits ON TOP of that
kernel boundary (namespace + NetworkPolicy + RBAC + per-principal workspace).

stdlib only; `python3 hostile-run-blast-radius-check.py` (exit 0 = contained + teeth intact).
